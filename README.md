A number is special, if it is exactly divisible by 15. A number is big, if it is greater than 999.
A number is weird, if it is exactly divisible by 5 and 6 but not 18. A number is scary if it is big or
weird. Write a Java program to test a given number. For example:
Enter a number: 450
450 is special but not scary.
Enter a number: 750
750 is special, weird and scary but not big.
